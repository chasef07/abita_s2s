# Abita S2S

A Python LiveKit worker for Abita's voice receptionist. One job owns one call:
one `AgentSession`, one `CallState`, and one shared HTTP client. GPT-Live handles
speech and turn-taking; its delegated thinker invokes the application tools.

## Start here

- [Eval scenarios](evals/README.md): sandbox prerequisites and LiveKit simulation usage.
- [Environment settings](.env.example): configuration names and examples.

## Local development

Use Python 3.13 and uv. Configure `.env.local`; exported variables take precedence.
Console audio requires live credentials and an explicit office.

```sh
uv sync --locked
uv run abita-s2s --help
ABITA_CONSOLE_OFFICE=spring-hill uv run abita-s2s console
uv run abita-s2s dev
uv run --no-sync python -m unittest discover -s tests -q
uv run --no-sync ruff check .
```

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/abita_s2s/tools/` | Model-facing tools, grouped by capability. |
| `src/abita_s2s/integrations/` | Patient, registration, and scheduling HTTP adapters. |
| `src/abita_s2s/runtime/` | Call composition, reporting, and observability. |
| `src/abita_s2s/prompts/` | Speaker and thinker instructions. |
| `tests/` | Offline behavior, integration contracts, and release checks. |
| `evals/scenarios/` | LiveKit simulation scenario YAML. |
| `scripts/` | Release publishing and deployment operations. |

Deploy middleware contracts before their agent consumer. Offline tests and packaged
eval scenarios do not establish live audio, SIP, or provider-write correctness;
see the eval guide for verification boundaries.
